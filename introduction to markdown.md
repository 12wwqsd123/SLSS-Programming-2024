To make a list we can use the following:
* This is item one
* This is item two
    * This is subpoint in the list
        * This  is another subpoint

- THis is another list
- We can use dashes instead of *s

1. This is item one
2. THis is item two
   - THis **subpoint**  under teo
3. THis is _item_ three

# Blockquote

These are usually show quote, thigs that someone has said

It's useful to give emphasis to a collection of lines

> " **Do or do not** , there is no try . "
> Yodo
> * This is a list
> * THis is the second part of the list in a blockquote
>
> There is a space above
